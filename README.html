  <h1>Aria's Webpage is AWESOME!</h1>

  <div>My first time creating a webpage was 1-10-17 and it is so cool because I can show the world that I have my own "website".
    I can't wait until my next coding club because I get to continue to work on my project with my group or work on my webpage.
    My favorite class on Tuesdays is choir because I get to go to coding club afterward for a whole hour!It feels so professional
    to have your own webpage and you can tell everyone to go check it out.I decided to put some of my favorite colors in my 
    webpage because it is MINE.Now I will be able to tell anyone that asks what I do in coding club that I do projects and make 
    Webpages!Not everyone gets to make thier own webpage, but I do!

  <p style="background-color:thistle;">
   On 1-31-17 I edited my webpage and tried some animations on it. I am learning how to html code every once in a while in coding club and 
    am hoping to someday actually create my own website for my necklace selling business. In my small business I make necklaces with 
    sometimes valuable materials such as pearls and precious stones. I make a whole stock of necklaces and go to fairs to sell them.
