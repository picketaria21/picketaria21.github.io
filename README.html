   On 1-31-17 I edited my webpage and tried some animations on it. I am learning how to html code every once in a while in coding club and 
    am hoping to someday actually create my own website for my necklace selling business. In my small business I make necklaces with 
    sometimes valuable materials such as pearls and precious stones. I make a whole stock of necklaces and go to fairs to sell them.
